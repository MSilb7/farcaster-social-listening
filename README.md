# farcaster-social-listening
If I make a github repo, then I have to actually start on the thing.

_Disclaimer: I am not a software engineer, my code sucks, and I am dumb._

### WIP Use Cases
1. Topic Listening: Given a topic (i.e. protocol name, EIP, company name, feature name) - answer "what is the current meta & how has it changed over time?"
 - Overall sentiment, key related terms, sentiment among related terms. Who are the top influencers on each end of the sentiment & what terms do they use?
2. Event Tracking: Given some event topics (i.e. protocol release, token distribution) - similarly answer "what is the impact?" driven by social sentiment.
